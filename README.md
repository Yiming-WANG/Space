"v" key: protected by shield. 

For shapes, if they are hit by shots, shapes should split into size down-graded shapes (if the hit shape is in size of small, it should disappear). 
For player ship, if it is hit by any shapes, the player-ship would be reset to the center of space, and score would be reset to zero.
